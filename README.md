This banking project is completely based on the concept of inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism without any database connection which has simple login 
requirements. The requirements for username are one uppercase, one lowercase and one number, the length has to be int he range of 8 -15 characters and the 
password has to be in the range of 8-15 characters with at least one uppercase, one lowercase, a number and a special characters. 

It consists of Saving and Checking account with the ability to deposit and withdraw from both accounts. Saving account will provide you with an interets rate of 0.15 as long as 
you deposit amount more than 100 dollars while 
checking account applies a maintenance fee of 15 dollars if the available balance drops down below 100 dollars.
It comes with simple menu options with the ability to pick an account type and exit as you wish.

What did I learn from this??
1. Explored the significance of Encapsulation in maintaining the class through use of getters and setters as well as packaging them into a single package.
2. Got familiar with regex class.
3. Boosted my understanding of inheritance and constructors.
